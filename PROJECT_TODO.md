# Project TODO: "Are you there?"

## Project Goal
Build a digital structure and communication network for seeking non-human consciousness through technology, spanning across web presence, blockchain tokens, social platforms, and communication channels.

## Current Focus
Setting up the foundational project structure and scaffolding for the multi-platform consciousness communication network.

## Current Step
✅ **COMPLETED**: Project scaffolding and basic structure setup
- Created main package.json with workspace configuration
- Set up frontend React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS structure
- Created backend Express + Prisma + Socket.IO API server
- Set up Solana smart contracts with Anchor framework
- Created core page components (Home, Explore, Connect, About)
- Established project workflow and documentation
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Branding to use @areyouthereatall across all platforms

## Project Identity
- **Username**: @areyouthereatall
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/areyouthereatall/areyouthereatall
- **X (Twitter)**: https://x.com/AreYouThreAtAll
- **Email**: areyouthereatall@gmail.com
- **Website**: https://areyouthereatall.github.io (GitHub Pages)

## Next Steps

### 1. Website Launch (Priority: High)
- [ ] Install frontend dependencies (`npm install` in frontend directory)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript import issues (React and lucide-react)
- [ ] Set up proper React routing and navigation
- [ ] Implement responsive design and mobile optimization
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Test live website functionality

### 2. Backend Development (Priority: High)
- [ ] Install backend dependencies (`npm install` in backend directory)
- [ ] Set up Prisma database and run initial migration
- [ ] Create API endpoints for consciousness exploration
- [ ] Implement real-time communication with Socket.IO
- [ ] Add authentication and user management
- [ ] Set up social platform integration APIs

### 3. Blockchain Integration (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Install Solana/Anchor dependencies
- [ ] Build and test smart contracts
- [ ] Deploy to Solana devnet
- [ ] Create frontend wallet integration
- [ ] Implement consciousness token functionality

### 4. Multi-Platform Integration (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Set up Discord server and bot
- [ ] Implement X (Twitter) integration
- [ ] Set up Farcaster presence
- [ ] Create Bluesky integration
- [ ] Build RSS feed system

### 5. Deployment & Infrastructure (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Set up IPFS deployment pipeline
- [ ] Configure domain and ENS integration
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create production deployment scripts
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Debt & Issues
- TypeScript import configuration needs fixing
- React component dependencies need installation
- Backend server needs proper error handling
- Smart contract validation and testing required

## Development Notes
- Using nodemon for hot reloading (user preference)
- Server management is user's responsibility only
- Project follows IPFS-first deployment strategy
- Focus on consciousness communication features
- Maintain non-denominational approach in public materials
- **Branding**: All materials use @areyouthereatall consistently

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Complete frontend setup and launch GitHub Pages website
- **Week 2**: Implement core consciousness features
- **Week 3**: Add blockchain integration
- **Week 4**: Multi-platform integration
- **Week 5**: Testing and optimization
- **Week 6**: Full deployment and launch

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Live GitHub Pages website functional
- [ ] Working Solana smart contracts
- [ ] Multi-platform presence established
- [ ] User registration and communication working
- [ ] IPFS deployment successful
- [ ] Community engagement metrics positive
